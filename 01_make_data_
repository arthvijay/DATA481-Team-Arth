Section 1: The goal of this task is to analyze how gasoline prices vary over time, specifically in relation to the various fuel grades.
Section 2: Some of the questions I hope to answer are as follows - 
        How do the gasoline prices in general change over time?
        Are there distinct patterns in gas sales?
        Do different fuel grades show specific trends, especially in relation to time?
Section 6:
        Gasoline prices, regardless of grade, all seemed to increase. Their greatest spikes seemed to be in the 2020-2025 period, as it shot from about 2 to 4 USD per gallon.
        The premium grade looks like it's consistently the most expensive, followed by midgrade and then regular.
        All the grades seem to fluctuate in a similar fashion, which shows that varying fuel grades are purchased relatively as frequently as one another.
